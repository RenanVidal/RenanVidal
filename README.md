## Hey there, curious soul 👋

Let me tell you a little about myself. :)

### 🧑‍💻 Public information

Hi, I’m Renan! I work as a Product Owner, Power BI Analyst, and I like to dip my toes into programming too — what I really enjoy is bridging the gap between problems and solutions, whether through data, dashboards, or out-of-the-box ideas.

I’ve got a strategic mindset, but I never let go of the technical side. I love understanding the user’s pain points, turning that into something that actually works, and yeah, getting my hands dirty in the code when needed. I get excited about innovation, automation, smarter processes and anything that makes life simpler (and better-looking, because no one deserves an ugly chart).

Outside of work, I’m a tabletop RPG addict, a bookworm (from fantasy to business strategy), and I never say no to a cold beer with friends — preferably while chatting about tech, pop culture, or guessing which character is going to die next.

I enjoy working with people who play as a team, laugh through the chaos, and believe that it's totally possible to build great products without losing the human side of things. If there's data and good humor involved, well… I'm all in.
