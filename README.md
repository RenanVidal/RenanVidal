## Hey there, curious soul 👋

I don’t know how you ended up here, but since you’re around… let me tell you a little about myself. :)

### 🧑‍💻 Public information

My name’s Renan, born and raised in Brazil. I'm one of those people who loves solving chaos with data, code, and a little bit of coffee (or a cold beer after hours, let’s be honest).

I’m a Product Owner, Power BI Analyst, and Programmer — passionate about blending product vision with hands-on execution. My mission? Turning confusion into clarity, numbers into smart decisions, and raw ideas into solid deliveries (preferably with a sexy dashboard involved).

When I'm not working, you'll probably find me DM'ing a tabletop RPG session, lost in a book, or figuring out new ways to automate even my grocery list.

### 🎲 Fun (and weirdly specific) facts about me

* I’ve been playing tabletop RPGs since my teenage years, and I still get hyped about epic battles, world-building, and chaotic dice rolls.
* I read *a lot* — from fantasy novels to business strategy books, especially the ones that make me go “damn, that’s a brilliant idea.”
* Yes, I once built a dashboard to monitor a barbecue. It involved grill temperature sensors and real-time Power BI. Don’t judge me.
* I truly believe every great product starts with *listening*. The rest? That’s what backlogs are for.
* Hit me up if you ever want to nerd out about data, craft beer, or how to gamify user onboarding.
